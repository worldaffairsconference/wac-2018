						<h1>China and Africa's New Era</h1>

						<p class="card-text">
							<p>Africa experiences the fastest growing demography and economy in the world; its need for foreign investment makes the continent a target for all companies and nations that seek new market possibilities. Over the last decade, investing into mines, roads, airports, hospitals, highways, and dams, China has become one of Africa’s biggest trading partners. As skepticism about its intentions in increasing economic, cultural, and, therefore, political presence in the continent, the plenary questions its positive and negative, short-term and long-term implications. At a moment in time when President Trump puts America first, Sino-African relations not only shape the African continent, but the nature of international affairs.</p>

						Rachel Pulfer has led Journalists for Human Rights since October 2011. On her watch, JHR has launched new programming in Canada, Tanzania, Jordan, South Sudan, Syria and most recently in South Africa, and built strong partnerships with both media and universities to implement this work. Prior to taking over as Executive Director, Pulfer managed media development projects in Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Pulfer came to JHR from an award-winning career in journalism: she was a Canadian Journalism Fellow at Massey College, building on a 10-year career in magazine journalism. She was the U.S. correspondent, editorial board member, and columnist for Canadian Business – Canada's national business news magazine, and previously worked at Azure and the Montreal Gazette. She appears regularly on panels on journalism and foreign affairs, including at the Banff Forum and providing input to Parliamentary committees, and as a commentator on CTV National News. Her journalism and op-eds have appeared in the Toronto Star, the Globe and Mail, the Walrus, Toronto Life, the Toronto Star, the Globe and Mail, the Ottawa Citizen and Maclean's.
As a humanitarian who grew up in Swaziland, Lesotho and Papua New Guinea, Pulfer believes JHR’s mission – empowering journalists to cover local human rights issues ethically and effectively – is an excellent way to put her profession to work for a greater good. She is delighted to be part of making that mission a reality.
